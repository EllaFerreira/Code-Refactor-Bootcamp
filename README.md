# Code Refractor

  Week1 - Code Refractor

  #Acceptance Criteria
  GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
  WHEN I view the source code
  THEN I find semantic HTML elements
  WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
  THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
  WHEN I view the image elements
  THEN I find accessible alt attributes
  WHEN I view the heading attributes
  THEN they fall in sequential order
  WHEN I view the title element
  THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

  #What I did
  I created a semantic HTML structure, using <nav>,<article>,<main> and <footer>.
  I commented on the HTML and CSS about each choice.
  I added the Alt attribute to the <img> to better describe it.
  I created id attributes to the <nav>.
  I created a title to the html link.
